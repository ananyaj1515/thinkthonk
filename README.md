# TikTok Mixtape

## Project Overview & Problem Statement

Our project, **TikTok Mixtape**, proposes a new way to create a transparent and legitimate flow of value from consumers to creators. Instead of relying solely on likes, views, or ad-based monetization, TikTok Mixtape automatically generates personalized montages of each user’s most engaging content from their favorite creators based on pre-decided metrics. This approach introduces:

- **Content Evaluation through Consumer Choice**: By analysing user interactions and engagements our solution curates personalised mixtape montages serving as a direct signal of consumer preferences while filtering out any bot-like postings
- **Profit-Sharing Mechanism**: Creators whose content is featured in user mixtapes can be rewarded proportionally, ensuring fairer distribution based on engagement.  
- **Transparent Value Transfer**: Consumers derive entertainment value from their mixtapes, while creators gain recognition and potential monetization from their content being featured, forming a clear value-sharing loop.  

This solution reimagines how consumers contribute to the ecosystem, making content consumption itself a meaningful act of creator support.
